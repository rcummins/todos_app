## Application description
Todos App is an app for organizing your to-do list. Todos App allows users to:
* Create an account and log in/out
* Create your todo items
* Create steps within each todo item
* Mark individual steps or whole todo items as done
* Delete steps and todo items

## Design docs
* [MVP feature list](https://github.com/rcummins/todos_app/wiki/MVP-feature-list)
* [Database schema](https://github.com/rcummins/todos_app/wiki/Database-schema)
* [State shape](https://github.com/rcummins/todos_app/wiki/State-shape)
* [Backend routes](https://github.com/rcummins/todos_app/wiki/Backend-routes)

## Future
Todos App is a work in progress. Here are some improvements I would like to make in the future:
* Optimize database calls by fetching only the todos and steps belonging to the current user
* Reduce the number of API calls by fetching steps along with todos in a single request
